Code Book
===========
This code book describes the tidy data set tidy_data.txt, in particular the variables contained within it.

The data set contains 180 observations (rows), one for each subject-activity pair, and 68 features (columns).  In the next section, the features are described, in the following format:

* Name of variable
  - Description of variable
  - Type of variable and possible values
  
The numerical variables are all unitless.
